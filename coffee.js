        description: 'Arabica coffee is the most commonly grown type of coffee, making up around 60% of commercially grown coffee. Arabica plants have the best quality when grown at high altitudes in volcanic soils, with plenty of rainfall. The downside to Arabica plants is that they are more susceptible to disease. Arabica coffee bean has an oval shape and is larger than a Robusta bean. \n There are dozens of varieties of Arabica coffee, including Bourbon, Caturra, Pacamara, and Typica. The extract taste of each Arabica coffee will depend on the variety, but it is generally sweeter and more complex than Robusta coffee. Good quality Arabica coffee has a medium body, bright acidity, and multiple layers of flavor and aroma. Most specialty coffees will be of the Arabica type.',

Robusta plants get their name because they are hardier than Arabica plants, and they are less prone to disease and grow well in wider environments, including low altitudes. Robusta beans are smaller, and rounder and have a higher concentration of caffeine than Arabica beans. \n Robusta coffee has many unidentified heirloom varieties, but you can categorize them into Erecta (upright varieties) or Nganda (spreading varieties). The taste of Robusta coffee beans is dark and earthy and can have bitter or burnt flavors. Although the flavor is considered inferior to Arabica, it can add complexity when used in Arabica-Robusta blends.',

Liberica coffee grows taller than Arabica or Robusta, with trees reaching 20 meters high. Liberica beans are longer than other coffee types and have a unique hook shape at one end. Libera coffee is lower in caffeine than either Arabica or Robusta. \n Due to the rarity of Liberica coffee, its varieties are not well known. The taste of Liberica coffee is sweeter than Arabica, with strong fruit and floral flavors, and it also has a smokiness and full-body reminiscent of Robusta coffee. ',
